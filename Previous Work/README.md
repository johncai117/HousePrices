Testing out Regression and Gradient-Boosting Techniques with Kaggle House Prices dataset

Link to Challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

In this work, I utilize XGBoost, Regression Trees, and Elastic Net. To impute missing data, I use a KNN imputer.

On the 5-fold validation, I achieve a R2 of 0.87 averaged using XGBoost.
